							<p>Starting the phase we had a solid basis of information about our users. We used that information to create paper prototypes to suss out any flaws, misread needs, or omissions in our understanding before moving on to digital prototyping in the next phase.</p>

							<p>The first draft of this paper prototype, incorportating what we learned from our users in the needs analysis phase, is shown below.</p>

							  <div class="column">
							  	<center><h3 class="major">Changes Made</h3></center>
							  	<b>Specified search:</b> Removal of “Interests” (e.g. “I like...art, music tavel, nature, food, books”) and changed focus of homepage to clarify what the site is about so that users who go on our site immediately know what the site is about. This would attract those who come on the website with an already existing purpose of volunteering, whereas the previous version were more helpful for those who wanted to “discover” volunteerism, or casually attend an event. This less so caters to our previous persona of “Here for It” Harry, and more so to our personas of “Obligated Oscar” and “Cause-Driven Cathy”, who would already have an idea of what they would like to do on our site. Hence the homepage now provides a quick way for them to get to their desired type of event. 

							  	<br></br>
							 	<b>Grid and map layouts tossed:</b> Single strips won out because grid view (not shown) was deemed too cluttered, especially with the 4 pieces of information and a picture we were putting into each one. With limited options as is, we don’t want users skimming pages and missing something just because they were too cluttered.
							  	<br />
							  	At the start of this phase, we thought an option for browsing by map view would meet user needs to minimize travel (shown to the right). However, in user testing this proved to be confusing and unable to convey the information clearly. Ultimately we removed it and went fully with strip listings, with visual location information (i.e. map) moved to the event pages themselves. </div>

							<p>After user test though we were altered to several problems with our design, namely in terms of confusing terminology or unclear UI, although the underlying structure made sense. We compiled these errors in a page by page break down. After following up with this we made small changes to make the workflow of the prototype easier to understand, giving us our second draft:</p>

							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/designdev/fullseconddraft.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/designdev/p1d2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/designdev/p2d2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/designdev/p3d2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/designdev/p4d2.jpg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>At this point we feel we have a more solid grasp of how to translate user needs and wants into interactive design elements that fufill those needs but not making it feel overdone.</p>
